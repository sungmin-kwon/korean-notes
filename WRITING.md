# Writing notes for 근거와 실재

This is the style and accuracy guide for the notes in `src/content/notes/`. It is written so that
any model, including a small local one, can read it and draft a note that matches the existing
ones. Read all of it before drafting. If there is room in the context, also read one finished
note as a model to imitate (see [Reference notes](#reference-notes)).

This site holds notes **in Korean** on grounded theory, realism and the methods and philosophy of
social science research. The reader is an educated Korean reader who knows social science
research, but not necessarily this method or school of thought. Write for that reader.

This guide is in English so that any model can follow it, but **the notes themselves are written
in Korean** (section 1a). The guide is shared with the other sites in the family. The parts that
belong to this site only are this opening, section 1a (Korean), the affiliation rule (section 1),
the tags (section 2), the short-note example (section 3), code (section 6), the known traps
(section 7) and the reference notes. See `SHARED.md`.

## The hard rules

Every one of these was broken in an earlier draft and had to be fixed after review. If you
remember nothing else from this file, follow these. Details are in the sections named.

1. **Work on a branch from the current `main`, and open a pull request.** Never push to `main`,
   and never merge your own PR. Fetch `main` first, so you follow the current version of this
   file (section 10).
2. **Run `npm run check` and `npm run build`; both must pass.** Then **open the page** in a
   browser and look at it, at full width and at phone width. Don't write "it renders" unless you
   did this (sections 6 and 9).
3. **Every computed number comes from a calculation you ran.** Code output in a note is pasted
   from a real run, never typed. If you couldn't run it, say so in the PR and leave the output out (section 7).
4. **Don't state a cause, a direction or a mechanism you can't support** with a source you
   opened or a calculation in the note. "X is the reason for Y" needs evidence (section 7).
5. **Every cited work is in a `## Sources` list with a working link**, and every link was opened
   or resolved. Never write a DOI, volume or page number from memory. Cite only what the text
   uses (section 6).
6. **Write in Korean, in 한다체, with no first-person singular** (나는, 제가). No `## Limits`
   section, no em dashes in the body, `$$` on its own lines (sections 1, 1a, 5 and 6).
7. **No affiliation or personal details.** Don't name or hint at a university, department,
   employer or project, and don't describe the author (section 1).
8. **Numbers shared between notes stay in sync.** If you change a number another note quotes,
   change it there too (section 7).
9. **End the PR description with what you could not verify.** An honest list is worth more than
   a clean-looking draft (section 9).

## 1. Voice

- **Plain, exact, and calm.** Say what is true and how we know. No hype, no "fascinating",
  no "in this note we will explore", no closing pleasantries or calls to action.
- **Explain, then show.** State the idea in a sentence, then make it concrete with a number,
  an equation, or a worked example.
- **Full sentences and short paragraphs** of two to five sentences. Lead each section with its
  point. Lists are for parallel items (sources, cases, options), not for a chain of reasoning.
- **No first-person singular.** Never "I", "me", "my" or "I'll". Write around it: "Throughout,
  the note uses one worked example", "This rests on reporting, not the ruling itself", "isn't
  checked here". When a first person truly can't be avoided, use "we" ("Translations are our
  own"), and use even that sparingly. Contractions (it's, doesn't) are fine.
- **No affiliation.** The site is a notebook, not a profile. Don't write "우리 학과", "our
  lab", or name a specific institution as the place the work happens, and don't describe the
  author. Name an institution only as the author of a cited work.
- **Punctuation:** en dash (–) for pairs and ranges: ethanol–water, McCabe–Thiele, 1–4.
  Avoid em dashes (—) in body text; use a comma, a colon, or a new sentence. One em dash in the
  `summary` line is fine. No arrow chains (A → B → C) in prose.
- **Emphasis:** **bold** a key term where it is defined, or the one fact a reader must not miss.
  *Italics* for a term being introduced (*congeners*, *Rayleigh distillation*) and for quoted
  prompts or examples. Don't bold whole sentences.
- **Correct the common story when it's wrong**, briefly and without drama: "so it doesn't
  concentrate cleanly in the heads, contrary to the common story."
- **Hedge only where there is real uncertainty**, and say what the uncertainty is. "A real pot
  still gives slightly stronger distillate than this one-stage model" is a good hedge. "It is
  generally thought that" is not.

## 1a. Korean

**The full Korean style sheet is [`STYLE-KO.md`](STYLE-KO.md), written in Korean. Read it before
drafting a note, and paste its checklist (section 9) into the PR.** It covers register, the site's
standard translations of terms, punctuation, spacing, the Korean citation format, and the
translationese that machine drafts fall into. The short version:

- **한다체** in notes: "근거이론은 … 방법이다", not "방법입니다". (The site's interface text and the
  About page use 합니다체; notes don't.)
- **No first-person singular**: never 나, 내가, 저, 제가. Write around it ("이 글은 …", "여기서는
  …"). If a first person truly can't be avoided, use 우리, sparingly. Quoted speech, such as an
  interview excerpt in quotation marks, may use any person; `npm run check` skips quoted text.
- **Terms**: give the established Korean term with the original in parentheses the first time,
  then the Korean alone: 근거이론(grounded theory), 비판적 실재론(critical realism). Where the
  Korean translation varies between authors, pick one, and name the other on first use
  ("축 코딩(axial coding, 축코딩이라고도 쓴다)").
- **Names**: Korean transliteration with the original on first use: 로이 바스카(Roy Bhaskar),
  then 바스카.
- **Titles**: 『』 around a book title, 「」 around an article or chapter title, with the original
  title in italics after a translated one: 『근거이론의 발견』(*The Discovery of Grounded Theory*).
- **Emphasis**: prefer **bold** to *italics* on Hangul. Browsers slant Hangul artificially, and it
  reads poorly. Italics are fine on Latin text.
- **Punctuation**: ordinary Korean punctuation; a full stop ends every sentence, including in
  lists of full sentences. Don't use an em dash in body text; one in `summary` is fine.
- **Spacing**: follow standard 띄어쓰기. The site breaks lines between words (word-break:
  keep-all), so a missing space glues two words into one long unbreakable one.
- **Ranges** take an en dash (45–60쪽), never a tilde: two single tildes on a line turn the text
  between them into strikethrough on this site.
- **Quoting a translation**: say whose translation it is. A translation made for the note is
  marked as such ("인용자 번역").

## 2. Files and frontmatter

One Markdown file per note in `src/content/notes/`. The file name, in kebab-case, is the
note's id and URL: `soft-targets.md` → `/notes/soft-targets/`. Don't rename a published note;
it breaks links.

```md
---
title: Forward vs. reverse KL          # omit for a short note
date: 2026-11-12                       # required, YYYY-MM-DD
updated: 2026-11-20                    # only when a published note changes materially
tags: [근거이론]                        # 근거이론, 실재론, 방법론; zero or more
summary: One line for the index.       # long notes
distillate: The boiled-down version.   # long notes
rough: true                            # unfinished thinking; leave out otherwise
draft: true                            # unfinished, not published; leave out otherwise
hidden: true                           # finished but withheld from the site; leave out otherwise
model: [Claude Opus 5.5]               # model(s) that wrote or revised it; never shown on the site
reviewed_by: [Claude Opus 5.5]         # optional: model(s) that did a separate review pass
---
```

- **Tags:** only these three: `근거이론` (grounded theory and its variants), `실재론` (realism,
  above all critical realism, as a philosophy of social science) and `방법론` (research design and
  other research interests that fit neither). The list lives in `site.config.mjs`, where each tag
  also has a Latin `slug` for its URL (`/tags/grounded-theory/`). The build fails on any other
  tag. Don't invent new tags; ask first.
- **File names** are in Latin letters and kebab-case, even for a Korean note
  (`critical-realism-three-domains.md`), so that URLs stay readable.
- **Hidden notes:** `hidden: true` keeps a finished note off the site: no page, and not in the
  index, tag pages, RSS or search. A `note:` link to it from a visible note turns into plain text
  and becomes a link again when the note is unhidden. `draft: true` builds the same way but means
  unfinished. `ADMIN.md` at the repo root lists every note with its status; it is regenerated by
  `npm run admin` and before every build, and is not deployed (but the repo is public).
  **To unhide a note:** delete its `hidden: true` line, run `npm run build` (which also refreshes
  `ADMIN.md`), check that the note and the links to it render, and commit both files.
- **Model:** list every model that drafted or substantially revised the note, earliest first,
  as it calls itself (`[Mistral Large 4, Claude Opus 5.5]`). Add a name when a model revises the
  note; never remove one. The site never shows it, but the repo is public, so anyone reading the
  source can see it. Leave it out for a note written by hand.
- **Reviewed by (optional):** when a separate review pass checked the note (section 10), list the
  reviewing model(s) here. A reviewer that also edits the text goes in `model` too, so `model`
  is always the full list and `reviewed_by` only records who did a review. Not every note gets
  a separate review; leave the field out when none happened. Never shown on the site.
- **No H1 in the body.** The title comes from frontmatter. Sections are `##`; use `###` rarely.
- Quote a frontmatter value with `"..."` if it contains a colon followed by a space.

## 3. Short notes and long notes

**A short note** has no title. It is two to five sentences, shown in full on the index: one
observation, number, or correction, with enough context to stand alone. No headings, no
distillate. Example:

```md
---
date: 2026-11-14
tags: [근거이론]
model: [Claude Opus 5.5]
---
이론적 표집은 통계적 표집과 목적이 다르다. 통계적 표집은 모집단을 대표하도록 표본을 미리
정하지만, 이론적 표집은 분석 중에 떠오른 범주가 다음 표본을 정한다. 그래서 근거이론 연구의
표본 크기는 미리 정해 두기보다 이론적 포화에 이르렀는지로 판단한다.
```

**A long note** has a title, `summary`, `distillate`, and sections. The existing long notes run
1,500–3,000 words. Length should come from worked detail, not from repetition. **In Korean,
aim for about 4,500–8,000 characters of body text, counting spaces** (not counting frontmatter
and 참고문헌). An English word comes to roughly 2.5–3 Korean characters, so this is about the
same depth. A Korean draft under about 3,500 characters is usually a summary,
not a note: go further into the worked example, the reasoning behind each position and what it
changes in practice.

Use `rough: true` (shown as 미완) for a note that is honest thinking-in-progress: unchecked
numbers, open questions, an argument you're not sure of. Say in the text what is unchecked.
**Not being able to read a book page by page is not, by itself, a reason for `rough`.** A claim
about a book is checked when it rests on the book's table of contents or publisher description,
on a peer-reviewed source whose abstract you read and that states the claim, or on a passage you
quote. Leave `rough` off when every claim is checked that way, and list what rests on secondary
sources in the PR's **Not verified**. Use `rough` only when a claim in the note itself is
uncertain or contested and the text says so.

## 4. The summary and the distillate

**`summary`** is one line on the index under the title. It says what the note covers, and a
long one may list its parts after an em dash: "Knowledge distillation for language models,
worked through on one next-token example — soft targets and temperature, the T² factor, …".

**`distillate`** is shown at the top of the note. It is the note boiled down to two to four
sentences that make sense alone: the conclusion, the key numbers, and the main limit. A reader
who stops after the distillate should still come away knowing the answer. It is not a teaser
and not a table of contents. It is **plain text**: no links, no `note:` targets, no bold, no
code. Markdown there shows up on the page as literal brackets and asterisks.

> Good: "For a 50/50 feed split into 95% and 5% products at α = 2.5 and 1.5 × minimum reflux,
> that comes to 12 stages. It only holds for binary mixtures with constant molar overflow, so it
> teaches how a column works rather than designing one."
>
> Bad: "This note explores the McCabe–Thiele method and why it matters."

Every number in the summary or distillate must also appear, identically, in the body.

## 5. Shape of a long note

1. **Opening paragraph (no heading):** what the thing is, why it matters, where it comes from
   (who named it, when). Two to four sentences.
2. **Safety or legal note, if any,** as a one-paragraph `>` blockquote right after the opening.
3. **One worked example, set up early** and carried through the whole note. Put its parameters
   in a small table (`| | value |`). Every later section returns to the same numbers.
4. **Sections that each answer one question.** Headings are short noun phrases or questions:
   "The q-line", "Why match a distribution and not just the answer", "Evaluation is the hard part".
5. **Caveats where they bite, not in a closing section.** There is no `## Limits` section. When an
   assumption changes a result, say so in the section that uses it ("this holds only for constant
   molar overflow"). Keep a caveat only if a careful reader would be misled without it; cut generic
   lines such as "real data is messier" or "this is not a verdict".
6. **Optional ending:** a `## Summary` paragraph, or `## Open questions`
   as a short list. Don't do both.
7. **`## Sources` last**, listing every cited work with its link (section 6).

## 6. Conventions

**Math (KaTeX).** Inline `$x_D$`. For display math, the opening `$$` and the closing `$$` each
go on **a line by themselves**, with the formula on the lines between:

```md
$$
y = \frac{\alpha x}{1 + (\alpha - 1) x}
$$
```

Written on one line (`$$y = \frac{…}{…}$$`), the parser treats it as *inline* math: fractions
shrink to text size, sub- and superscripts get cramped, and the equation isn't centered. The
build doesn't warn about it, but `npm run check` does.

**Keep display equations narrow.** A long equation is clipped at the column edge, worst on a
phone. If a formula, its substituted numbers and its result don't fit in about 60 characters of
rendered width, split it into two display blocks (the general form, then the numbers), or move
the unit into the sentence. Check every equation on the rendered page at phone width (about
400 px). Matrix rows end with `\\`, never a single `\`.

Define every symbol in words the first time it appears ("where $W$ is the moles of liquid in
the pot"). Show the general formula, then substitute the example's numbers:

```md
$$
D = F\,\frac{x_F - x_B}{x_D - x_B} = 100 \cdot \frac{0.45}{0.90} = 50 \text{ kmol/h}
$$
```

Use `\text{}` for units and words inside math, and `\mathrm{KL}`, `\mathrm{ABV}` for named
operators.

**Numbers and units.** Always give units and the basis: mole fraction, wt %, or ABV (% by
volume at 20 °C); kmol/h; nats. State the temperature and pressure that data holds at. Use a
space between number and unit (78.4 °C, 2.4 L), and × for multiplication in prose. Keep only as
many digits as the source supports, usually two or three significant figures.

**Tables.** For data, comparisons, and the steps of a worked example. Units go in the header or
the first column. Cite the source of any data table in the sentence above it ("Carey and Lewis,
1932, as tabulated in standard textbooks").

**Code.** Rare on this site. When a note needs it (a small text-analysis or sampling example),
use Python or base R, with no packages beyond the standard library. It must run as written: include imports, name the shapes in comments
(`# [batch, seq, vocab]`), and keep it under about 30 lines (a simulation that feeds a figure may
run longer). Code illustrates the idea; it isn't a library.

**Code output is pasted, never written.** Run the code exactly as it appears in the note, and copy
what it printed into the output block below it. Every number the prose takes from the code must
appear in that output. If the code uses random numbers, set a seed (`set.seed(1)`,
`np.random.default_rng(1)`) so the output is reproducible. If you can't run the code, don't
include an output block, and say in the PR that the code is unrun.

**Figures.** Inline `<svg>` only, with `role="img"`, a descriptive `aria-label`, and a
`<title>`. Colors come from CSS variables so dark mode works: `style="stroke: var(--ink)"`,
`var(--muted)`, `var(--accent)`, `var(--rule)`, and `fill="currentColor"` for text. Put an
italic caption after the SVG, with **a blank line** between `</svg>` and the caption (without it,
the caption is swallowed into the HTML block and shows literal `*` and `$`). **Plot data from coordinates computed by a
script, never by hand.** If you can't compute them, leave the figure out and write
`<!-- TODO figure: … -->`. Computed coordinates aren't enough on their own: **render the figure**
(open it in a browser, or screenshot it with a headless one) and check that no label or number
crosses a curve or line, that each region label sits in the region it names, and that axis
labels line up with their values. Check it in dark mode too.

**Links.** Between notes: `[industrial column](note:reading-a-mccabe-thiele-diagram)`, using the
other note's file name without `.md`. Never write relative paths like `../notes/…`. Link to a
note only if it exists. External links only to primary or stable sources (papers, standards,
official docs).

**Citations.** Name the authors and year in the text: "글레이저와 스트라우스(1967)". Collect
every cited work in a `## 참고문헌` list at the end of the note (the Korean name of the `Sources`
list in the rest of this guide; `npm run check` accepts either), one entry per line, in the
original language of the work. Many of the books in this field have no DOI; for those, link the
publisher's page for the edition cited, and give the original year with a reissue's year:

```md
## 참고문헌

- B. G. Glaser, A. L. Strauss, *The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research* (Aldine, 1967; Routledge 재간행, 2017). [doi:10.4324/9780203793206](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203793206)
```

When the note quotes or relies on a Korean translation, cite the translation too, with its
translator, publisher and year, and a link to the publisher's or a library catalogue page.

- **Every entry has a link**: `https://doi.org/…` for a paper with a DOI, `https://arxiv.org/abs/…`
  for a preprint, or the official page for a standard, dataset or piece of software. Link the DOI
  and the arXiv id when both exist.
- **Check every entry before you write it.** Resolve the DOI (`https://api.crossref.org/works/<doi>`
  returns the title, authors, journal, volume and pages) and copy the details from what comes
  back. About ten DOIs, volumes or page ranges written from memory were wrong in the first
  drafts of the `genes` notes on a sibling site. If you can't resolve a work, don't cite it; say in the PR that it needs a source.
- **Cite only what the text needs**: a work the note quotes a number, result or method from. Not
  background reading, not a second source for the same point.
- **Describe a cited work only by what it says.** Before writing "Park et al. (2023) converted
  the hospital's records to OMOP", read the abstract and check it says that. A paper's topic is
  not its finding.
- Footnotes (`[^1]`) are for asides, or for a source tied to one specific claim, such as a spec
  limit from a data sheet. A footnote that cites a work still carries its link.

**Cite only what a reader can check.** A source must be specific enough to look up: a DOI or
arXiv id, a standard's number, a stable database page (for physical data, the
[NIST Chemistry WebBook](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/)), or a book with its edition and
the table or page. Never cite from memory: a textbook appendix named from memory, for constants
that turn out not to be in it, is worse than no citation. If you can't open the source, say
where the number came from ("standard Antoine constants, not checked against a primary source
here") or mark the note `rough: true`.

## 7. Accuracy rules

The style is easy to copy; the accuracy is not. Earlier drafts of most notes had real
errors. These rules matter more than anything above.

1. **Recompute every number** in a worked example, preferably with code, and check that tables,
   prose, distillate, and figure agree with each other.
2. **Check every factual claim against a source** you could name. If you can't, cut it, or mark
   the note `rough: true` and say what is unchecked.
3. **Don't invent precision.** "About 97% ABV" beats a fake "96.85%".
4. **Round once, then use the rounded numbers everywhere.** Every value in the distillate, the
   tables, the prose, and each substituted equation must be the rounded value the body quotes,
   and an equation written with rounded inputs must give its stated result with those inputs.
   If the text says "at 95.1 °C", the vapor pressures shown must be the ones at 95.1 °C, not at
   an unrounded 95.14 °C; if it says $\alpha = 2.47$, the next line computes with 2.47. When
   rounding makes a check miss (759 instead of 760 mmHg), quote one more digit or say "about".
5. **Stay inside a fit's range.** Empirical fits (Antoine constants, correlations) come with a
   stated range; say so when a calculation or figure goes beyond it.
6. **Name a real example only if it is documented** to be what you say. A model trained from
   scratch is not a distilled model because it is small.
7. **Watch the basis of every percentage** (mole, mass, volume) and the sign and direction of
   every effect (reads high or low, rises or falls, positive or negative slope).
8. **Prefer mechanism over folklore.** Explain why something happens; if the usual explanation
   is wrong, say so and give the right one.
9. **A cause needs evidence.** Write "X causes Y", "X is why Y", or "Y happens because X" only
   when a source you opened says so, or the note's own numbers show it. When the note can compute
   it, compute it. Otherwise write what is known ("the two are related", "one proposed reason
   is", with a source) or leave it out.
10. **Check the direction twice.** For every effect, bias, correction or sign, ask which way it
    goes and why, then check it against a source or a small calculation. Reviewers caught
    reversed directions in two notes (the hydrometer correction and winner's curse in MR).
11. **Count the right thing.** Say what each number counts and keep it the same through the
    calculation: alleles or people, moles or kilograms, tokens or words, per head or per layer.
12. **Check every identifier against its source**: gene names, concept ids, model names, version
    numbers, dates. One letter turned LIPG into LPA and reversed a well-known result.
13. **Keep shared numbers in sync.** Before changing a number, search the other notes for it
    (`grep -rn "1.49" src/content/notes/`). If another note quotes it, update both in the same PR.
    The medical-codes note reuses the GWAS note's toy numbers, for example.
14. **Date anything that will go stale.** Records, the state of a field, a pending court case,
    "the largest so far": put them in a section that says "as of" a month and year, so a later
    edit knows what to refresh. A dated section is a snapshot, not a promise of upkeep: refresh it
    only when the note is edited for another reason.
15. **Attribute each position to the person who holds it.** When a note contrasts schools or
    authors, every claim says whose view it is and rests on that author's own work or a source
    that states it. A draft gave Strauss and Corbin's view of the literature (read it early, as a
    source of sensitivity) as Glaser's, who said the opposite.
16. **Check what a source argues, not only that it exists.** Read its abstract or the
    publisher's description and make sure it supports the sentence that cites it. A paper whose
    title criticizes a theory is not support for that theory. If you can open neither the work
    nor its abstract, cut the claim instead of keeping it with an "unverified" note.
17. **Keep look-alike distinctions apart.** When a framework has two distinctions that resemble
    each other, state each from its source and never map one onto the other. A draft equated
    critical realism's three domains (real, actual, empirical) with its two dimensions
    (intransitive, transitive).
18. **A worked example must agree with its own data.** Every code, category or conclusion drawn
    from made-up excerpts points to excerpts that actually contain it, quoted word for word.
    Don't claim the example's result is new or "absent from the literature".
19. **Crossref describes the edition the DOI points to.** A reissue's record gives the reissue
    year and sometimes the wrong author or subtitle. Take the original publisher, year and
    authors from the book or a library record, and when the link is a later edition, say so
    ("링크는 3판").

### Known traps (each one appeared in an earlier draft)

| Topic | Wrong | Right |
| --- | --- | --- |
| links | `../posts/other-note/` | `note:other-note` |
| figure captions | caption on the line straight after `</svg>` (shows literal `*…*` and raw `$…$`) | a blank line between `</svg>` and the italic caption |
| display math | `$$y = \frac{a}{b}$$` on one line (renders inline and cramped) | `$$` alone on the line above and the line below the formula |
| data citations | a textbook appendix cited from memory | a source that was actually opened: NIST WebBook, DOI, or edition and table |
| DOIs and page numbers | written from memory (wrong volume, pages, journal or author) | resolved through Crossref and copied from the result |
| distillate | ends with a `[link](note:…)` | plain text; the link goes in the body |
| Hangul in italics | `*발견*` (slanted artificially, hard to read) | **bold**, or 『』 for a title |
| translated terms | a different Korean term for the same concept in each section | one term, with the original in parentheses on first use |
| ranges in Korean | `1~4쪽과 5~6쪽` (renders with "4쪽과 5" struck through) | `1–4쪽과 5–6쪽` |
| translationese | 세 단계를 가진다, 수집되어진다, 연구자에 의해 만들어진다 | 세 단계가 있다, 수집된다, 연구자가 만든다 (STYLE-KO.md, section 6) |
| Sources link text | the full URL as the link text | a short label (itl.nist.gov, 1.3.6.6); a long URL can't wrap and scrolls the page sideways on a phone |
| Korean brackets | 》근거이론의 발견《, 〈논문 제목〉 | 『근거이론의 발견』, 「논문 제목」 (`npm run check` flags the wrong ones) |
| Korean names | 스트라스, 그라제리안 | 스트라우스, 글레이저 (STYLE-KO.md, section 2) |
| Glaser on the literature | the literature in the field sharpens sensitivity (that is Strauss and Corbin, 1990) | don't read the substantive literature until categories emerge; sensitivity comes from theoretical codes (Glaser, 1978, 1992) |
| grounded theory coding | axial coding as part of Glaser's method | Glaser: open, selective, theoretical coding. Strauss and Corbin: open, axial, selective |
| epistemic fallacy | mistaking empirical data for real structures | reducing what exists to what can be known (Bhaskar, 1975); collapsing the domains is its consequence |
| domains and dimensions | the real is intransitive, the empirical is transitive | the three domains are all on the object (intransitive) side; the transitive dimension is knowledge |
| social structures | exist independently of society | depend on people's activities and concepts, but exist apart from the theories about them (Bhaskar, 1979) |

## 8. Template for a long note

```md
---
title: <Short noun phrase or question>
summary: <What it covers, in one line> — <part>, <part>, <part>.
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [<근거이론|실재론|방법론>]
distillate: <The answer in one sentence.> <The key number from the worked example.> <The main limit or caveat.>
model: [<the model writing this>]
---

<What it is and why it matters, two to four sentences. Who named it and when.>

<Optional: > one-paragraph safety or legal note.>

Throughout, the note uses one worked example:

| | value |
| --- | --- |
| <parameter> | <value with units> |

## <First idea>

<State it. Define symbols. General formula, then the example's numbers.>

## <Second idea>

...

## 참고문헌

- <Authors>, "<Title>", *<Journal>* <vol>, <pages> (<year>). [doi:<doi>](https://doi.org/<doi>)
```

For a full example, see the reference note at the end of this file.

## 9. Self-check before handing over a draft

Go through this list and fix anything that fails. Then report which items you could not verify.

- [ ] `npm run check` and `npm run build` both pass.
- [ ] The page was opened in a browser, at full width and at phone width: no red KaTeX errors, no
      clipped equations, no literal `$`, `*` or `[`, figures and captions in place.
- [ ] Frontmatter has `date` and `model` (plus `reviewed_by` if a separate review happened); a long note also has `title`, `summary`,
      `distillate`, and tags from the list in `site.config.mjs`.
- [ ] Korean prose in 한다체; no 나, 내가, 저 or 제가 outside quotations; 우리 only where unavoidable.
- [ ] Each term has its original in parentheses on first use, and the same Korean term throughout.
- [ ] The distillate stands alone, gives the answer and a key number, and matches the body.
- [ ] One worked example runs through the note, with its parameters in a table.
- [ ] Every number has units and a basis, and every number in the example was recomputed.
- [ ] Every symbol is defined in words on first use.
- [ ] Every named paper, model, and dataset is real and described correctly.
- [ ] None of the known traps in section 7 appears.
- [ ] Internal links use `note:` and point to notes that exist.
- [ ] Display math has `$$` alone on its own line before and after the formula.
- [ ] Code runs as written, and every output block was pasted from a real run (with a seed if
      random). SVG uses CSS variables and computed coordinates.
- [ ] The figure was rendered and checked: no label crosses a curve, region labels sit in their
      regions, and it reads in dark mode.
- [ ] Every cited work is in `## Sources` with a link, and every DOI was resolved, not recalled.
- [ ] Each source supports the sentence that cites it (its abstract was read), and each view in
      a comparison is given to the author who holds it (section 7, rules 15–17).
- [ ] Each cited work is described by what its abstract says, and each is used in the text.
- [ ] Every "because", "causes" or "the reason" has a source or a calculation behind it, and
      every direction (high/low, up/down, toward/away from the null) was checked.
- [ ] Any number also used in another note matches there (search with `grep`).
- [ ] No affiliation and nothing about the author.
- [ ] Rounded values are the same everywhere, and each worked equation checks with them.
- [ ] No H1, no em dashes in body text, no hype, no "in this note we will".
- [ ] No `## Limits` section. Each caveat sits in the section it qualifies and would mislead a
      careful reader if cut.
- [ ] Anything unchecked is either cut or flagged, with `rough: true`.

Paste this list into the PR description with each box ticked or not, and add a section
**Not verified** listing every claim, number or source you couldn't check. An empty list is fine
only if it's true.

## 10. Workflow: draft cheap, review strong

Most notes are drafted by a cheaper model and reviewed by a stronger one. A guide like this
fixes structure and voice well, but a smaller model will still make factual errors, so the
review is where accuracy comes from. The reviewer follows `REVIEWING.md`.

1. **Branch.** `git fetch origin main` and `git switch -c <short-name> origin/main`. A branch cut
   from an old `main` follows an old version of this file; one draft broke its whole page that way.
2. **Draft** with this file, one reference note close to the topic, and the source material.
   Run the code, run `npm run check` and `npm run build`, and open the page.
3. **Open a PR**, never a direct push to `main`. The description has the self-check from section
   9, the **Not verified** list, and the commands you ran with their result.
4. **Review** with a stronger model, following `REVIEWING.md`. The review lists errors as *must
   fix* and *should fix*.
5. **Fix** on the same branch. Address every item; in the PR, say for each one what you changed,
   or why you didn't. Don't fix things the review didn't ask for in the same commit.
6. **Merge** only when Sungmin approves. A drafting model never merges its own PR.

When a review finds a new kind of mistake, add it to the known-traps table in section 7, so the
next draft avoids it.

This split is one option, not a requirement. A note can also be written and checked by one
model, or by hand. Whatever the route, the accuracy rules in section 7 still apply, `model`
lists every model that wrote or revised the note, and `reviewed_by` is filled in only when a
separate review pass took place.

## Reference notes

These notes show the target quality. Give a drafting model the one closest to the
new note's topic:

- `glaserian-emergence-vs-forcing.md` (`근거이론`): one made-up worked example (three interview
  excerpts) carried through every section, each position attributed to its author, a comparison
  table, Korean terms with the originals, a 참고문헌 list.
- `naive-realism.md` (`실재론`): a made-up survey example with computed numbers, two look-alike
  distinctions kept apart (domains and dimensions), and what the theory changes in research
  practice.

When a new note becomes a better example, add it here and add any new trap to section 7.
